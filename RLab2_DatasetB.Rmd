::: {custom-style="mystyle1"}
In the EPI590R Week 4 lab, you learned how to make tables and figures
with Microsoft Excel. In this lab, we will use the same datasets to
produce similar output with R.

We will keep all of our work from R Lab 1 here since we will need some
of the variables we created. We will skip over the epi curves we already
went over in the last lab unless there are questions about those.

Let's make sure we have the necessary packages installed and loaded.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
**`readxl`** to read Excel files

**`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** to manipulate data

**`lubridate`** to work with dates

**`stringr`** to work with strings

**`ggplot2`** to create data visualizations

**`knitr`** to help with our images in the document

**`RColorBrewer`** for colors

**`tidyr`** to transpose data

**`gt`** for tables

**`openxlsx`** for exporting tables to Excel
:::

<br>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# install.packages(c("readxl", "dlpyr", "ggplot2"))
library(readxl)     
library(dplyr)     
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)   
library(knitr)
library(stringr)
library(RColorBrewer)

# New for Lab 2
library(tidyr)
library(gt)
library(openxlsx)
```

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 1 - Import the data (**`Dataset_B.xlsx`**).
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
*Note: There are some warning messages about specific dates here. All of
these are in the `reprt_creationdt_FALSE` field which we aren't using
here so we are going to ignore these for now.*
:::

<br>

```{r}
dataB <- read_excel("data\\Dataset_B.xlsx")
```

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 2 - Explore the data.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
The **`dplyr::glimpse()`** function will show us the number of rows and
columns, list the variables and variable types, and give us an idea of
the data values. We could also use **`str()`** for this. The
**`head()`** function will print just a few rows of the dataset, here
**`n=10`** rows is specified.

Next, to explore the data we will use **`lapply()`** to ask R to return
the most appropriate type of output based on variable type. Numeric
variables will use **`summary()`**, factor and character variables with
use **`table()`**, and datetime variables will also use **`summary()`**.

*Note that we are using results='hide' in the code chunk to suppress all
of this output from the knitted Word doc.*.
:::

<br>

```{r, results = 'hide'}
glimpse(dataB)

head(dataB, n=10)

lapply(dataB, function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) return(summary(x))
  if (is.factor(x)) return(table(x))
  if (is.character(x)) return(table(x))
  if (inherits(x, "POSIXct") || inherits(x, "POSIXt")) {return(summary(x))}
})
```

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 3 - Clean and prepare data for analysis.
:::

<br>

Based on the previous Excel lab, we will be using **`pos_sampledt`** for
our cases, and we may want to do some grouping by race (**`case_race`**)
and age (**`case_dob`**) later on, so we will start by cleaning those
variables up a bit.

<br><br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Here we are creating 3 new variables:

The **`age`** variable is calculated by subtracting the date of birth
(**`case_dob`**) from the positive test date (**`pos_sampledt`**) and
converting that to years; this will give us the age at the time of
diagnosis.

From there, the **`age_group`** factor variable is created by using the
continuous age values to make 10 year age groups, with the exception of
the last group which will have all values \>=70 years.

Next, a **`race_cat`** factor variable is created that collapses values
of "Other" and "Multiple Races" into one category.

It looks like we have one missing value for **`pos_sampledt`**, so in
our last step we will remove this row with **`filter()`**.
:::

<br>

```{r}
dataB <- dataB %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(difftime(pos_sampledt, case_dob, units = "days")) %/% 365.25,
    age_group = as.factor(cut(age, 
       breaks = c(seq(0, 70, by = 10), Inf),  
       right = FALSE,  
       labels = c(paste(seq(0, 60, by = 10), seq(9, 69, by = 10), sep = "-"), "70+"),
       include.lowest = TRUE)),
    race_cat = as.factor(case_when(
        case_race == "AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE" ~ "American Indian/Alaska Native",
        case_race == "ASIAN" ~ "Asian",
        case_race == "BLACK" ~ "Black",
        case_race == "NATIVE HAWAIIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER" ~ "Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander",
        case_race == "WHITE" ~ "White",
        case_race == "OTHER" ~ "Other",
        TRUE ~ "Unknown")))

# Check age variables
check <- dataB %>% select(pos_sampledt, case_dob, age, age_group)
head(check, n=10)

# Check race variable
dataB %>% count(case_race, race_cat) %>%  
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = race_cat, values_from = n, values_fill = list(n = 0))

# Remove row with missing pos_sampledt value
dataB <- dataB %>% filter(!is.na(pos_sampledt))
```

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 4 - Plot the case counts by day.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we will use **`summarise()`** to count the number of cases by
day. Our **`pos_sampledt`** variable is already by day (exact dates) so
we will use this as the grouping variable.
:::

<br>

```{r}
dataB_cases_per_day <- dataB %>%
  group_by(pos_sampledt) %>%
  summarise(cases = n()) %>%
  mutate(pos_sampledt=as.Date(pos_sampledt)) 

# Check results
head(dataB_cases_per_day, n=10)
```

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Before we try to plot anything, let's take a look at the date range for
**`pos_sampledt`**. We will double check to make sure there are no NAs
(there shouldn't be because of our earlier filter), and then use
**`range()`**. We are including **`na.rm=T`** so that this step works
even if there are NAs, but again we should not have any.

It looks like our date range is **Feb 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021**.

We can also get a range of values for the case counts to inform how we
set up our plot axis.

It looks like we have daily counts from **1 to 61**.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Check to make sure there are no NAs 
table(is.na(dataB_cases_per_day$pos_sampledt))

# Now to get the date range 
range(dataB_cases_per_day$pos_sampledt, na.rm = TRUE)

# And range of values for the cases
range(dataB_cases_per_day$cases)
```

<br>

Okay, now let's get to work on a daily case plot.

<br><br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we are going to use our date range to make a start and end point.
We want to make sure our plot is uniform, so we will use the list of
dates to enforce consistent 1 day increments, even if we don't have any
cases on some days (we will merge this list of dates with our own data
and set the case count for any days without cases to zero).

We will also go ahead and create a variable to store the cumulative sum
of cases (**`cumulative_case_count`**) using the **`cumsum()`**
function.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Dataset of all dates in the range we have
all_dates <- data.frame(daterange = seq(as.Date("2020-02-01"), as.Date("2021-06-30"), by = "day"))

# Merge with our data and insert 0's if no cases 
dataB_cases_per_day_rev <- merge(x=all_dates, 
                                 y=dataB_cases_per_day, 
                                 by.x = "daterange", 
                                 by.y="pos_sampledt", 
                                 all.x=T) %>%
  mutate(cases = replace_na(cases, 0)) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_case_count = cumsum(cases))

# Check result (using n=20 here because there are lots of zeros)
head(dataB_cases_per_day_rev, n=20)
```

<br>

Next, let's make a plot of the cases by day using **`ggplot`**.

<br><br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Note that the new date variable in the merged file is called
**`daterange`** and the case count variable is called **`cases`**; these
will become our x and y for the plot.

**`geom_col(fill = "#002060")`** is setting the color for our columns.
You can swap that out for any hex code or color name in the quotes.

**`labs()`** allows us to set a main title for the plot (title=), as
well as titles for the x (x=) and y (y=) axis. You can edit those labels
as needed.

**`scale_x_date()`** is used to change the format of the date labels on
the x axis. The **%b** gives an abbreviated month name (i.e., Jan, Feb,
Mar), **%d** gives a 2-digit day, and **%Y** gives a 4-digit year. You
can try using other date formats here as well. The **`breaks`** argument
is specifying 2 week intervals for the dates between the start and end
value we set.

**`scale_y_continuous()`** is creating some specifications for the
values on the y axis based on our maximum daily case counts.

**`theme_light()`** and **`theme()`** elements are just customizing the
look a bit more. For the x axis text, we are making sure those dates are
vertical (angle=90) so they don't overlap, similar to the way they look
in Excel.

Note that we are storing the whole plot in an object called **`fig`** so
we can easily save it as an image file. We are using **`theme_light()`**
here because this looks best in the png file.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Provide start and end dates to force plot boundaries
start_date <- as.Date("2020-02-01")  
end_date <- as.Date("2021-06-30")   

# Daily plot
fig1a <- ggplot(dataB_cases_per_day_rev, aes(x = daterange, y = cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#002060") +
  labs(title = "Figure 1 V1. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2020-2021",
       x = "Date of Positive Test",
       y = "Daily Case Count") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %d, %Y", 
               breaks = seq(start_date, end_date, by="2 weeks")) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 12),  
     breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 2)) +
  theme_light() +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 1 V1 Dataset B.png", plot = fig1a, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 1 V1 Dataset B.png")
```

<br>

Now let's fancy this up a bit more like you did in Excel. Here we will
copy and paste the same basic plot and add some additional features.

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
**`geom_line()`** is used to overlay a line with our cumulative case
count (**`cumulative_case_count`**). Here we are using 12/3000 to
rescale the cumulative case count to match the scale we have for daily
cases.

**`sec.axis()`** in **`scale_y_continuous()`** allows us to have a
secondary axis on the right side of the plot for the cumulative case
count while keeping the scale we have for daily case count on the left.
We will use increments of 500 for this one. By reworking the aes
settings in this version we can use **`scale_fill_manual`** and
**`scale_color_manual`** to set colors for the daily case count columns
and the cumulative case total line. Again, feel free to adjust these
color hex codes - check out [Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)
for guidance.

In the **`theme()`** section we will specify some info for the legend so
we can get a key at the bottom with the colors for our columns and line.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Plot
fig1b <- ggplot(dataB_cases_per_day_rev, aes(x = daterange)) +
  geom_col(aes(y=cases, fill = "Daily Cases"), show.legend = TRUE) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cumulative_case_count * (65/5500), color = "Cumulative Cases"), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1 V2. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2020-2021",
       x = "Date of Positive Test",
       y = "Daily Case Count") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %d, %Y", 
               breaks = seq(start_date, end_date, by="2 weeks")) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 65),
    breaks = seq(0, 65, by = 5),
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ .*(5500/65), name = "Cumulative Case Count", breaks = seq(0, 3000, by = 500))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#002060", labels = "Daily Cases") +  
  scale_color_manual(values = "#00AC45", labels = "Cumulative Cases") +  
  theme_light() +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = NA, shape = NA)),
         fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(color = NA)))

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 1 V2 Dataset B.png", plot = fig1b, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 1 V2 Dataset B.png")
```

<br><br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 5 - Plot the case counts by month.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we will use **`summarise()`** to count the number of cases by
month. Here, **`as.Date(cut(pos_sampledt, "month"))`** will group the
counts by unique values for month.
:::

<br>

```{r}
dataB_cases_per_month <- dataB %>%
  mutate(month = as.Date(cut(pos_sampledt, "month"))) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(cases = n())

# Check results
head(dataB_cases_per_month, n=10)
```

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Again, before we try to plot anything, let's take a look at the date
range for **`month`**. We will double check to make sure there are no
NAs (no months without any cases).

It looks like our date range is **Feb 2020 to Jun 2021**.

We can also get a range of values for the case counts to inform how we
set up our plot axis.

It looks like we have monthly counts from **35 to 1220**.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Check to make sure there are no NAs 
table(is.na(dataB_cases_per_month$month))

# Now to get the date range 
range(dataB_cases_per_month$month, na.rm = TRUE)

# And range of values for the cases
range(dataB_cases_per_month$cases)
```

<br>

Now let's make the monthly plot.

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Note that the new date variable is called **`month`** and the case count
variable is called **`cases`**; these will become our x and y for the
plot.

The elements of the monthly plot are similar to the daily plot above,
but we have done a few extra things.

For the monthly plot, the **`scale_x_date()`** breaks are 1-month
intervals.

The **`custom_labels`** function is allowing us to plot the month
abbreviations on the x axis but only including the year value with the
month when the year changes, otherwise the axis is really busy and
repetitive.

We are also using **`geom_text()`** to insert a label with the number of
cases inside each column; you can adjust the placement, size, and color
of these labels as needed.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Function to help with some custom labels for our x axis
custom_labels <- function(dates) {
  months <- format(dates, "%b") 
  years <- format(dates, "%Y")    
  labels <- ifelse(duplicated(years), months, paste(months, years, sep = "\n"))
  return(labels)
}

# Plot
fig2 <- ggplot(dataB_cases_per_month, aes(x = month, y = cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#002060") +
  geom_text(aes(label = cases), vjust = 1.5, color = "white", size=2.5, fontface="bold") +
  labs(title = "Figure 2. Monthly Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2020-2021",
       x = "Date of Positive Test",
       y = "Confirmed Cases") +
  scale_x_date(labels = custom_labels, breaks = seq(start_date, end_date, by = "1 month")) +
  theme_light()

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 2 Dataset B.png", plot = fig2, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 2 Dataset B.png")


```

<br><br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 6 - Make some stratified weekly plots.
:::

<br>

*Figures 3 and 4 below were adapted from Batra, Neale, et al. The
Epidemiologist R Handbook. 2021.* <br>

First, let's make a weekly plot stratified by race. We will go back to
using the original file here so we have all of our other grouping
variables.

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Note that our race categories are alphabetical here, we would have to
reorder our factor variable to put these in a different order. You can
use **`forcats::fct_relevel`** for that.

For the weekly breaks, week_start=1 is based on Monday (7 would be
Sunday). Floor and ceiling options are used to create the start and end
of the sequence from Mon to Sun. In the histogram, closed = "left"
counts cases from the starting point (Mon). The labs dynamic caption
allows us to stamp values from out dataset in the text.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Create breaks by week
breaks_by_week <- seq.Date(
  from = floor_date(min(as.Date(dataB$pos_sampledt, na.rm=T)),   "week", week_start = 1), 
  to   = ceiling_date(max(as.Date(dataB$pos_sampledt, na.rm=T)), "week", week_start = 1), 
  by   = "week")

# Plot 
fig3 <- ggplot(dataB) + 
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = as.Date(pos_sampledt),
      group = race_cat,
      fill = race_cat),
    color = "black",
    breaks = breaks_by_week,
    closed = "left") +
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0,0),          
    date_breaks = "2 months",      
    date_minor_breaks = "1 month",       
    label = scales::label_date_short()) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired", name = "Race") + 
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", hjust = 0), 
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey")) + 
  labs(title = "Figure 3. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2020-2021",
       subtitle = "Weekly cases by race",
       fill = "Race",
       x = "Week of diagnosis",
       y = "Weekly cases reported",
       caption  = stringr::str_glue("n = {nrow(dataB)} Cases from {format(min(dataB$pos_sampledt, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')} to {format(max(dataB$pos_sampledt, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')}\n{nrow(dataB %>% filter(is.na(pos_sampledt)))} cases missing diagnosis date"))

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 3 Dataset B.png", plot = fig3, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 3 Dataset B.png")


```

<br>

Now let's make one more stratified by age group. We will use facets for
this to get mini plots for each age group.

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Here just to make the facets simpler, we will exclude the records with
NA values for age.

The **`gghighlight::gghighlight()`** option is commented out, but this
will put an outline of the full epidemic in the background behind the
age group plots. You may need to rescale your image if you want to use
this.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Get rid of records without age
dataB_rev <- dataB %>% filter(!is.na(age_group))

# Labels for facets
my_labels <- as_labeller(c(
     "0-9"   = "Ages 0-9",
     "10-19" = "Ages 10-19",
     "20-29" = "Ages 20-29",
     "30-39" = "Ages 30-39",
     "40-49" = "Ages 40-49",
     "50-59" = "Ages 50-59",
     "60-69" = "Ages 60-69",
     "70+"   = "Age 70+"))

# Create breaks by week 
breaks_by_week <- seq.Date(
  from = floor_date(min(as.Date(dataB_rev$pos_sampledt, na.rm=T)),   "week", week_start = 1), 
  to   = ceiling_date(max(as.Date(dataB_rev$pos_sampledt, na.rm=T)), "week", week_start = 1), 
  by   = "week")

# Plot 
fig4 <- ggplot(dataB_rev) + 
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = as.Date(pos_sampledt),
      group = age_group,
      fill = age_group),
    color = "black",
    breaks = breaks_by_week,
    closed = "left") +
  #gghighlight::gghighlight() +
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0,0),          
    date_breaks = "2 months",      
    date_minor_breaks = "1 month",       
    label = scales::label_date_short()) +

        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "darkgray")) + 
   facet_wrap(~age_group,                          
              ncol = 4,                         
              strip.position = "top",
              labeller = my_labels) +   
  labs(title = "Figure 4. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2020-2021",

Step 7 - Create some frequencies by race and make a table.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we will use **`group_by`** and **`summarise`** to create counts
and percentages by race. In this example we will also use
**`bind_rows`** to add on an extra overall total row for our table.

Next, we will use **`gt()`** to create table of results. This one looks
pretty good in both R and the knitted Word doc. In the table step, we
can control the number of decimals displayed with our percentages,
header labels, and we can bold our total row as well.

**TRY IT!** Use the race example we just completed to generate values
and create a table using the *age group* variable. <br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Let's do this again but this time we will make a table with both race
and age group.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Here we are just combining the race and age group steps, with a few
adjustments. In the combined table, we are adding some header rows
without data and renaming things to be consistent. *Note that we could
do the frequency calculations in one step as well but it would require
converting the data to long format.*
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Table by race
freq_table_byrace <- dataB %>%
  group_by(race_cat) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    percentage = (n() / nrow(dataB)) * 100) %>%

              race_cat = "Total",

<br> These tables look decent in Word as is, but sometimes you want to
do more customization manually. Sometimes exporting tables to Excel can
be really handy for that. <br>

```{r}
# Shortcut to put this in Excel for more formatting options
#openxlsx::write.xlsx(combo_table, file="output\\final_combo_table.xlsx")

```

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 8 - Make an age distribution chart.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
To recreate the stacked horizontal bar chart you made in Excel, we will
adjust the groups slightly and make a bar plot. This one will be
presented in order from the smallest to largest percentages but you
could rework it to be in order by group as well. We will also use
**`geom_text`** to add some data labels and a custom note using x and y
values to place the note in a specific place.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Exclude the total row
freq_table_byage2 <- freq_table_byage %>%
  filter(age_group != "Total") 

# Reorder the age groups based on the values 
freq_table_byage2 <- freq_table_byage2 %>%
  arrange(desc(percentage)) %>%  
  mutate(age_group = factor(age_group, levels = age_group))  

fig5 <- ggplot(freq_table_byage2, aes(x = "",  y = percentage, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +  
  coord_flip() +  # Horizontal bar
  labs(title = "Fig X. Age Distribution of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2020-2021 ",
       x = "",
       y = "Percentage of Cases") +

        axis.text.y = element_blank(),

        legend.position = "bottom") +  
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")),  
             position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 2.5, color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = "----------30-59 year olds account for half of all cases----------"),

Step 9 - Make a pie chart to highlight some specific age results.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Let's say you would like to highlight some results for a specific age
group. Here we will re-categorize age as 70+ vs \<70 years and make a
pie chart to show this comparison.
:::

<br>

```{r}
# Make new age category variable and summarize cases for these groups
freq_table_byage3 <- freq_table_byage %>%
  filter(age_group != "Total") %>%
  mutate(age_group2=factor(ifelse(age_group=="70+", 0, 1), 
                           levels=0:1, labels=c("70+ years", "<70 years"))) %>% 
  group_by(age_group2) %>%
  summarise(percentage = sum(percentage), count = sum(count))

fig6 <- ggplot(freq_table_byage3, aes(x = "", y = percentage, fill = age_group2)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "The majority of new cases were among those 70+ years old.",
       fill = "Age Group") +
    geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), 
            color = "white", fontface = "bold") + 
  theme_light() +  
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),  
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),  
        axis.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#a8ddb5", "#0868ac"))  

# Save plot as png image

# Print image here

```

::: {custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 10 - Summarize case counts by symptoms reported.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="mystyle3"}
Let's say we want to summarize case counts by some other variables such
as symptoms reported. We will use **`summarise()`** to sum the cases by
each symptom variable and then generate a long version of these totals
with **`pivot_longer`**. Next we will create a clustered bar chart that
displays these totals by symptom next to the overall total cases for
each age group.

```{r}
# For dataset B using sym_fever, sym_cough, sym_headache and calculating total cases for anyone with a 'Yes'
freq_table_byage4 <- dataB %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    percentage = (n() / nrow(dataB)) * 100,
    tot_fever = sum(sym_fever == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE),
    tot_cough = sum(sym_cough == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE),
    tot_headache = sum(sym_headache == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(age_group) 

# Reformat data 
long_data <- freq_table_byage4 %>%
  select(age_group, count, tot_fever, tot_cough, tot_headache) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(count, tot_fever, tot_cough, tot_headache),
               names_to = "category",
               values_to = "count")

fig7 <- ggplot(long_data, aes(x = age_group, y = count, fill = category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +  # Side by side bars
  labs(title = "Case Counts by Symptoms and Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",

       fill = "Symptoms") +
  theme_light() +

                    labels = c("tot_fever" = "Fever",   # Custom label for fever
                               "tot_cough" = "Cough", # Custom label for nausea
                               "tot_headache" = "Headache")) +  # Custom colors for symptoms
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 7 Dataset B.png", plot = fig7, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 500)
