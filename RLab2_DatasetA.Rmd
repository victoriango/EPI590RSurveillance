:::{custom-style="mystyle1"}
In the EPI590R Week 4 lab, you learned how to make tables and figures with Microsoft Excel. In this lab, we will use the same datasets to produce similar output with R. 

We will keep all of our work from R Lab 1 here since we will need some of the variables we created. We will skip over the epi curves we already went over in the last lab unless there are questions about those.

Let's make sure we have the necessary packages installed and loaded. 
:::
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
**`readxl`** to read Excel files

**`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** to manipulate data

**`lubridate`** to work with dates

**`stringr`** to work with strings

**`ggplot2`** to create data visualizations 

**`knitr`** to help with our images in the document

**`RColorBrewer`** for colors

**`tidyr`** to transpose data

**`gt`** for tables

**`openxlsx`** for exporting tables to Excel

:::
<br>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# install.packages(c("readxl", "dlpyr", "ggplot2"))
library(readxl)     
library(dplyr)     
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)   
library(knitr)
library(stringr)
library(RColorBrewer)

# New for Lab 2
library(tidyr)
library(gt)
library(openxlsx)
```

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 1 - Import the data (**`Dataset_A.xlsx`**).
:::
<br> 

```{r}
dataA <- read_excel("data\\Dataset_A.xlsx")
```
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 2 - Explore the data. 
:::
<br> 

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
The **`dplyr::glimpse()`** function will show us the number of rows and columns, list the variables and variable types, and give us an idea of the data values. We could also use **`str()`** for this. The **`head()`** function will print just a few rows of the dataset, here **`n=10`** rows is specified.  

Next, to explore the data we will use **`lapply()`** to ask R to return the most appropriate type of output based on variable type. Numeric variables will use **`summary()`**, factor and character variables with use **`table()`**, and datetime variables will also use **`summary()`**. 

*Note that we are using results='hide' in the code chunk to suppress all of this output from the knitted Word doc.*.
:::
<br>

```{r, results = 'hide'}
glimpse(dataA)

head(dataA, n=10)

lapply(dataA, function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) return(summary(x))
  if (is.factor(x)) return(table(x))
  if (is.character(x)) return(table(x))
  if (inherits(x, "POSIXct") || inherits(x, "POSIXt")) {return(summary(x))}
})
```
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 3 - Clean and prepare data for analysis. 
:::
<br>

Based on the previous Excel lab, we will be using **`pos_test_date`** for our cases, and we may want to do some grouping by race (**`race`**) and age (**`DOB`**) later on, so we will start by cleaning those variables up a bit. 

<br><br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Here we are creating 3 new variables:

The **`age`** variable is calculated by subtracting the date of birth (**`DOB`**) from the positive test date (**`pos_test_date`**) and converting that to years; this will give us the age at the time of diagnosis. 

From there, the **`age_group`** factor variable is created by using the continuous age values to make 10 year age groups, with the exception of the last group which will have all values >=70 years.

Next, a **`race_cat`** factor variable is created that collapses values of "Other" and "Multiple Races" into one category.

It looks like we have one missing value for **`pos_test_date`**, so in our last step we will remove this row with **`filter()`**.
:::
<br>

```{r}
dataA <- dataA %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(difftime(pos_test_date, DOB, units = "days")) %/% 365.25,
    age_group = as.factor(cut(age, 
       breaks = c(seq(0, 70, by = 10), Inf),  
       right = FALSE,  
       labels = c(paste(seq(0, 60, by = 10), seq(9, 69, by = 10), sep = "-"), "70+"),
       include.lowest = TRUE)),
    race_cat = as.factor(case_when(
      race == "American Indian/Alaska Native" ~ "American Indian/Alaska Native",
      race == "Asian" ~ "Asian",
      race == "Black" ~ "Black",
      race == "Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander" ~ "Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander",
      race == "White" ~ "White",
      race %in% c("Other", "Multiple Races") ~ "Other or Multiple Races",
      TRUE ~ "Unknown")))

# Check age variables
check <- dataA %>% select(pos_test_date, DOB, age, age_group)
head(check, n=10)

# Check race variable
dataA %>% count(race, race_cat) %>%  
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = race_cat, values_from = n, values_fill = list(n = 0))

# Remove row with missing pos_test_date value
dataA <- dataA %>% filter(!is.na(pos_test_date))

```
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 4 - Plot the case counts by day.
:::
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we will use **`summarise()`** to count the number of cases by day. Our **`pos_test_date`** variable is already by day (exact dates) so we will use this as the grouping variable.  
:::
<br>

```{r}
dataA_cases_per_day <- dataA %>%
  group_by(pos_test_date) %>%
  summarise(cases = n()) %>%
  mutate(pos_test_date=as.Date(pos_test_date)) 

# Check results
head(dataA_cases_per_day, n=10)
```
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Before we try to plot anything, let's take a look at the date range for **`pos_test_date`**. We will double check to make sure there are no NAs (there shouldn't be because of our earlier filter), and then use **`range()`**. We are including **`na.rm=T`** so that this step works even if there are NAs, but again we should not have any.

It looks like our date range is **Jan 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023**.

We can also get a range of values for the case counts to inform how we set up our plot axis.

It looks like we have daily counts from **1 to 11**. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Check to make sure there are no NAs 
table(is.na(dataA_cases_per_day$pos_test_date))

# Now to get the date range 
range(dataA_cases_per_day$pos_test_date, na.rm = TRUE)

# And range of values for the cases
range(dataA_cases_per_day$cases)
```
<br>

Okay, now let's get to work on a daily case plot.

<br><br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we are going to use our date range to make a start and end point. We want to make sure our plot is uniform, so we will use the list of dates to enforce consistent 1 day increments, even if we don't have any cases on some days (we will merge this list of dates with our own data and set the case count for any days without cases to zero).

We will also go ahead and create a variable to store the cumulative sum of cases (**`cumulative_case_count`**) using the **`cumsum()`** function. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Dataset of all dates in the range we have
all_dates <- data.frame(daterange = seq(as.Date("2022-01-01"), as.Date("2023-12-31"), by = "day"))

# Merge with our data and insert 0's if no cases 
dataA_cases_per_day_rev <- merge(x=all_dates, 
                                 y=dataA_cases_per_day, 
                                 by.x = "daterange", 
                                 by.y="pos_test_date", 
                                 all.x=T) %>%
  mutate(cases = replace_na(cases, 0)) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_case_count = cumsum(cases))

# Check result
head(dataA_cases_per_day_rev, n=10)
```
<br>

Next, let's make a plot of the cases by day using **`ggplot`**.

<br><br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Note that the new date variable in the merged file is called **`daterange`** and the case count variable is called **`cases`**; these will become our x and y for the plot. 

**`geom_col(fill = "#002060")`** is setting the color for our columns. You can swap that out for any hex code or color name in the quotes.

**`labs()`** allows us to set a main title for the plot (title=), as well as titles for the x (x=) and y (y=) axis. You can edit those labels as needed.

**`scale_x_date()`** is used to change the format of the date labels on the x axis. The **%b** gives an abbreviated month name (i.e., Jan, Feb, Mar), **%d** gives a 2-digit day, and **%Y** gives a 4-digit year. You can try using other date formats here as well. The **`breaks`** argument is specifying 2 week intervals for the dates between the start and end value we set. 

**`scale_y_continuous()`** is creating some specifications for the values on the y axis based on our maximum daily case counts.

**`theme_light()`** and **`theme()`** elements are just customizing the look a bit more. For the x axis text, we are making sure those dates are vertical (angle=90) so they don't overlap, similar to the way they look in Excel. 

Note that we are storing the whole plot in an object called **`fig`** so we can easily save it as an image file. We are using **`theme_light()`** here because this looks best in the png file.
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Provide start and end dates to force plot boundaries
start_date <- as.Date("2022-01-01")  
end_date <- as.Date("2023-12-31")    

# Daily plot
fig1a <- ggplot(dataA_cases_per_day_rev, aes(x = daterange, y = cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#002060") +
  labs(title = "Figure 1 V1. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2022-2023",
       x = "Date of Positive Test",
       y = "Daily Case Count") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %d, %Y", 
               breaks = seq(start_date, end_date, by="2 weeks")) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 12),  
     breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 2)) +
  theme_light() +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 1 V1 Dataset A.png", plot = fig1a, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 1 V1 Dataset A.png")
```
<br>

Now let's fancy this up a bit more like you did in Excel. Here we will copy and paste the same basic plot and add some additional features. 

<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
**`geom_line()`** is used to overlay a line with our cumulative case count (**`cumulative_case_count`**). Here we are using 12/3000 to rescale the cumulative case count to match the scale we have for daily cases. 

**`sec.axis()`** in **`scale_y_continuous()`** allows us to have a secondary axis on the right side of the plot for the cumulative case count while keeping the scale we have for daily case count on the left. We will use increments of 500 for this one. By reworking the aes settings in this version we can use **`scale_fill_manual`** and **`scale_color_manual`** to set colors for the daily case count columns and the cumulative case total line. Again, feel free to adjust these color hex codes - check out [Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) for guidance.   

In the **`theme()`** section we will specify some info for the legend so we can get a key at the bottom with the colors for our columns and line. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Plot
fig1b <- ggplot(dataA_cases_per_day_rev, aes(x = daterange)) +
  geom_col(aes(y=cases, fill = "Daily Cases"), show.legend = TRUE) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cumulative_case_count * (12/3000), color = "Cumulative Cases"), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1 V2. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2022-2023",
       x = "Date of Positive Test",
       y = "Daily Case Count") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %d, %Y", 
               breaks = seq(start_date, end_date, by="2 weeks")) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 12),
    breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 2),
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ .*(3000/12), name = "Cumulative Case Count", breaks = seq(0, 3000, by = 500))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#002060", labels = "Daily Cases") +  
  scale_color_manual(values = "#00AC45", labels = "Cumulative Cases") +  
  theme_light() +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = NA, shape = NA)),
         fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(color = NA)))

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 1 V2 Dataset A.png", plot = fig1b, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 1 V2 Dataset A.png")
```
<br><br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 5 - Plot the case counts by month.
:::
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we will use **`summarise()`** to count the number of cases by month. Here, **`as.Date(cut(pos_test_date, "month"))`** will group the counts by unique values for month. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
dataA_cases_per_month <- dataA %>%
  mutate(month = as.Date(cut(pos_test_date, "month"))) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(cases = n())

# Check results
head(dataA_cases_per_month, n=10)
```
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Again, before we try to plot anything, let's take a look at the date range for **`month`**. We will double check to make sure there are no NAs (no months without any cases).

It looks like our date range is **Jan 2022 to December 2023**.

We can also get a range of values for the case counts to inform how we set up our plot axis.

It looks like we have monthly counts from **100 to 144**. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Check to make sure there are no NAs 
table(is.na(dataA_cases_per_month$month))

# Now to get the date range 
range(dataA_cases_per_month$month, na.rm = TRUE)

# And range of values for the cases
range(dataA_cases_per_month$cases)
```
<br>

Now let's make the monthly plot. 

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Note that the new date variable is called **`month`** and the case count variable is called **`cases`**; these will become our x and y for the plot. 

The elements of the monthly plot are similar to the daily plot above, but we have done a few extra things.

For the monthly plot, the **`scale_x_date()`** breaks are 1-month intervals. 

The **`custom_labels`** function is allowing us to plot the month abbreviations on the x axis but only including the year value with the month when the year changes, otherwise the axis is really busy and repetitive.  

We are also using **`geom_text()`** to insert a label with the number of cases inside each column; you can adjust the placement, size, and color of these labels as needed. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Function to help with some custom labels for our x axis
custom_labels <- function(dates) {
  months <- format(dates, "%b") 
  years <- format(dates, "%Y")    
  labels <- ifelse(duplicated(years), months, paste(months, years, sep = "\n"))
  return(labels)
}

# Plot
fig2 <- ggplot(dataA_cases_per_month, aes(x = month, y = cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#002060") +
  geom_text(aes(label = cases), vjust = 1.5, color = "white", size=2.5, fontface="bold") +
  labs(title = "Figure 2. Monthly Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2022-2023",
       x = "Date of Positive Test",
       y = "Confirmed Cases") +
  scale_x_date(labels = custom_labels, breaks = seq(start_date, end_date, by = "1 month")) +
  theme_light()

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 2 Dataset A.png", plot = fig2, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 2 Dataset A.png")
```
<br><br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 6 - Make some stratified weekly plots.
:::
<br>

*Figures 3 and 4 below were adapted from Batra, Neale, et al. The Epidemiologist R Handbook. 2021.*
<br>

First, let's make a weekly plot stratified by race. We will go back to using the original file here so we have all of our other grouping variables.

<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Note that our race categories are alphabetical here, we would have to reorder our factor variable to put these in a different order. You can use **`forcats::fct_relevel`** for that.

For the weekly breaks, week_start=1 is based on Monday (7 would be Sunday). Floor and ceiling options are used to create the start and end of the sequence from Mon to Sun. In the histogram, closed = "left" counts cases from the starting point (Mon). The labs dynamic caption allows us to stamp values from out dataset in the text.
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Create breaks by week
breaks_by_week <- seq.Date(
  from = floor_date(min(as.Date(dataA$pos_test_date, na.rm=T)),   "week", week_start = 1), 
  to   = ceiling_date(max(as.Date(dataA$pos_test_date, na.rm=T)), "week", week_start = 1), 
  by   = "week")

# Plot 
fig3 <- ggplot(dataA) + 
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = as.Date(pos_test_date),
      group = race_cat,
      fill = race_cat),
    color = "black",
    breaks = breaks_by_week,
    closed = "left") +
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0,0),          
    date_breaks = "2 months",      
    date_minor_breaks = "1 month",       
    label = scales::label_date_short()) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired", name = "Race") + 
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", hjust = 0), 
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey")) + 
  labs(title = "Figure 3. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2022-2023",
       subtitle = "Weekly cases by race",
       fill = "Race",
       x = "Week of diagnosis",
       y = "Weekly cases reported",
       caption  = stringr::str_glue("n = {nrow(dataA)} Cases from {format(min(dataA$pos_test_date, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')} to {format(max(dataA$pos_test_date, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')}\n{nrow(dataA %>% filter(is.na(pos_test_date)))} cases missing diagnosis date"))

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 3 Dataset A.png", plot = fig3, width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 3 Dataset A.png")
```
<br>

Now let's make one more stratified by age group. We will use facets for this to get mini plots for each age group.

<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Here just to make the facets simpler, we will exclude the records with NA values for age.

The **`gghighlight::gghighlight()`** option is commented out, but this will put an outline of the full epidemic in the background behind the age group plots. You may need to rescale your image if you want to use this.
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Get rid of records without age
dataA_rev <- dataA %>% filter(!is.na(age_group))

# Labels for facets
my_labels <- as_labeller(c(
     "0-9"   = "Ages 0-9",
     "10-19" = "Ages 10-19",
     "20-29" = "Ages 20-29",
     "30-39" = "Ages 30-39",
     "40-49" = "Ages 40-49",
     "50-59" = "Ages 50-59",
     "60-69" = "Ages 60-69",
     "70+"   = "Age 70+"))

# Create breaks by week 
breaks_by_week <- seq.Date(
  from = floor_date(min(as.Date(dataA_rev$pos_test_date, na.rm=T)),   "week", week_start = 1), 
  to   = ceiling_date(max(as.Date(dataA_rev$pos_test_date, na.rm=T)), "week", week_start = 1), 
  by   = "week")

# Plot 
fig4 <- ggplot(dataA_rev) + 
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = as.Date(pos_test_date),
      group = age_group,
      fill = age_group),
    color = "black",
    breaks = breaks_by_week,
    closed = "left") +
  #gghighlight::gghighlight() +
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0,0),          
    date_breaks = "2 months",      
    date_minor_breaks = "1 month",       
    label = scales::label_date_short()) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired", name = "age_group") + 
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", hjust = 0), 
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "none",
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "darkgray")) + 
   facet_wrap(~age_group,                          
              ncol = 4,                         
              strip.position = "top",
              labeller = my_labels) +   
  labs(title = "Figure 4. Number of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2022-2023",
       subtitle = "Weekly cases by age group",
       fill = "Age Group",
       x = "Week of diagnosis",
       y = "Weekly cases reported")

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 4 Dataset A.png", plot = fig4, width = 14, height = 10, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 4 Dataset A.png")

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
--- New code for Lab 2 starts here. ---
:::
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 7 - Create some frequencies by race and make a table. 
:::
<br> 

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
First, we will use **`group_by`** and **`summarise`** to create counts and percentages by race. In this example we will also use **`bind_rows`** to add on an extra overall total row for our table.

Next, we will use **`gt()`** to create table of results. This one looks pretty good in both R and the knitted Word doc. In the table step, we can control the number of decimals displayed with our percentages, header labels, and we can bold our total row as well. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
freq_table_byrace <- dataA %>%
  group_by(race_cat) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    percentage = (n() / nrow(dataA)) * 100) %>%
  arrange(race_cat) %>%
  bind_rows(
    summarise(dataA,
              race_cat = "Total",
              count = n(),
              percentage = 100))

**TRY IT!** Use the race example we just completed to generate values and create a table using the *age group* variable.
<br> 

```{r}
# Insert code here


```
<br>

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Let's do this again but this time we will make a table with both race and age group.
:::
<br> 

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Here we are just combining the race and age group steps, with a few adjustments. In the combined table, we are adding some header rows without data and renaming things to be consistent. *Note that we could do the frequency calculations in one step as well but it would require converting the data to long format.* 
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Table by race
freq_table_byrace <- dataA %>%
  group_by(race_cat) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    percentage = (n() / nrow(dataA)) * 100) %>%
  arrange(race_cat) %>%
  bind_rows(
    summarise(dataA,
              race_cat = "Total",
              count = n(),
              percentage = 100))

# Table by age
freq_table_byage <- dataA %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    percentage = (n() / nrow(dataA)) * 100) %>%
  arrange(age_group) %>%
  bind_rows(
    summarise(dataA,
              age_group = "Total",
              count = n(),
              percentage = 100)) %>%
   mutate(age_group = ifelse(is.na(age_group), "Unknown", age_group))

# Combo table
combo_table <- bind_rows(
  data.frame(category = "Race", count = NA, percentage = NA),  
  freq_table_byrace %>% select(race_cat, count, percentage) %>% rename(category = race_cat),
  data.frame(category = "Age Group", count = NA, percentage = NA),
  freq_table_byage %>% select(age_group, count, percentage) %>% rename(category = age_group))

final_combo_table <- combo_table %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Disease X Confirmed Case Count and Percentage of Cases in County Y, 2022-2023") %>%
   fmt_number(
    columns = c(percentage), 
    decimals = 1) %>%
  sub_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "") %>%  
  cols_label(
    category = "Category",   
    count = "Case Count",              
    percentage = "Percentage of Cases") %>%

      cell_text(weight = "bold")),

      rows = category %in% c("Race", "Age Group"))) %>%

These tables look decent in Word as is, but sometimes you want to do more customization manually. Sometimes exporting tables to Excel can be really handy for that.
<br>

```{r}
# Shortcut to put this in Excel for more formatting options
#openxlsx::write.xlsx(combo_table, file="output\\final_combo_table.xlsx")

```

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 8 - Make an age distribution chart.
:::
<br> 

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
To recreate the stacked horizontal bar chart you made in Excel, we will adjust the groups slightly and make a bar plot. This one will be presented in order from the smallest to largest percentages but you could rework it to be in order by group as well. We will also use **`geom_text`** to add some data labels and a custom note using x and y values to place the note in a specific place.
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Exclude the total row
freq_table_byage2 <- freq_table_byage %>%
  filter(age_group != "Total")  

# Reorder the age groups based on the values 
freq_table_byage2 <- freq_table_byage2 %>%
  arrange(desc(percentage)) %>%  
  mutate(age_group = factor(age_group, levels = age_group))  

fig5 <- ggplot(freq_table_byage2, aes(x = "",  y = percentage, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +  
  coord_flip() +  # Horizontal bar
  labs(title = "Fig X. Age Distribution of Confirmed Cases of Disease X in County Y, 2022-2023 ",
       x = "",
       y = "Percentage of Cases") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#f7fcf0", "#e0f3db", "#ccebc5", "#a8ddb5", "#7bccc4", "#4eb3d3",
                               "#2b8cbe", "#0868ac", "#084081"),
                    breaks = c("0-9", "10-19", "20-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59", "60-69", 
                               "70+", "Unknown"),
                    labels = c("0-9", "10-19", "20-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59", "60-69", 
                               "70+", "Unknown")) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),    
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom") +  
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")),  
             position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 2.5, color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = "----------30-59 year olds account for half of all cases----------"), 
            y = 50,  
            vjust = -12,  
            size = 3,  
            color = "black") 

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 5 Dataset A.png", plot = fig5, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 5 Dataset A.png")

```

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 9 - Make a pie chart to highlight some specific age results.
:::
<br> 

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Let's say you would like to highlight some results for a specific age group. Here we will re-categorize age as 70+ vs <70 years and make a pie chart to show this comparison.
:::
<br>

```{r}
# Make new age category variable and summarize cases for these groups
freq_table_byage3 <- freq_table_byage %>%
  filter(age_group != "Total") %>%
  mutate(age_group2=factor(ifelse(age_group=="70+", 0, 1), 
                           levels=0:1, labels=c("70+ years", "<70 years"))) %>% 
  group_by(age_group2) %>%
  summarise(percentage = sum(percentage), count = sum(count))

fig6 <- ggplot(freq_table_byage3, aes(x = "", y = percentage, fill = age_group2)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "The majority of new cases were among those 70+ years old.",
       fill = "Age Group") +
    geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), 
            color = "white", fontface = "bold") + 
  theme_light() +  
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),  
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),  
        axis.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#a8ddb5", "#0868ac"))  

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 6 Dataset A.png", plot = fig6, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 6 Dataset A.png")


```

:::{custom-style="mystyle2"}
Step 10 - Summarize case counts by symptoms reported.
:::
<br> 

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
Let's say we want to summarize case counts by some other variables such as symptoms reported. We will use **`summarise()`** to sum the cases by each symptom variable and then generate a long version of these totals with **`pivot_longer`**. Next we will create a clustered bar chart that displays these totals by symptom next to the overall total cases for each age group. 
:::
<br>

```{r}
# For dataset A using sym_fever, sym_nausea, sym_diarrhea and calculating total cases for anyone with a 'Yes'
freq_table_byage4 <- dataA %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    percentage = (n() / nrow(dataA)) * 100,
    tot_fever = sum(sym_fever == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE),
    tot_nausea = sum(sym_nausea == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE),
    tot_diarrhea = sum(sym_diarrhea == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(age_group) 

# Reformat data 
long_data <- freq_table_byage4 %>%
  select(age_group, count, tot_fever, tot_nausea, tot_diarrhea) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(count, tot_fever, tot_nausea, tot_diarrhea),
               names_to = "category",
               values_to = "count")

fig7 <- ggplot(long_data, aes(x = age_group, y = count, fill = category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +  # Side by side bars
  labs(title = "Case Counts by Symptoms and Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Symptoms") +
  theme_light() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("tot_fever" = "darkred", 
                               "tot_nausea" = "blue", 
                               "tot_diarrhea" = "gold"),
                    labels = c("tot_fever" = "Fever",   # Custom label for fever
                               "tot_nausea" = "Nausea", # Custom label for nausea
                               "tot_diarrhea" = "Diarrhea")) +  # Custom colors for symptoms
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 

# Save plot as png image 
ggsave("output\\Figure 7 Dataset A.png", plot = fig7, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 500)

# Print image here
knitr::include_graphics("output\\Figure 7 Dataset A.png")
